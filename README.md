# UniCatalogue

This is my University projesct for my Java Course , it is a program that allows student to log-in too see their status, courses, faculty, grades . Also allows to log in as a Teacher to add grades to students enrolled in the teacher's course.There is also a way of log in as an Admin that can add Students, Teachers, also can modify and delete Students and Teachers too. All of the data about these Students and Teachers, also Admins is stored in a MongoDB non-relational Database . 
The App also has a Graphic Interface done with Java FX that allows you to use the aplication easier.

Technolgies used: Java, JavaFX, MongoDB.
